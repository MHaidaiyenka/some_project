Represent a directed graph consisting of 7-10 vertices using an adjacency matrix. Specify the top-source, and then solve the following problem.
1. The shortest paths from the vertex source to all vertices of the digraph based on the Dijkstra algorithm.
2. The shortest distances between each pair of vertices of the digraph based on the Floyd algorithm.
